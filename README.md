# 2D Game Engine and Mini-Game

This project is a simple 2D game engine built using C++ and SDL2, designed to provide a foundation for developing basic 2D games. It includes essential features such as rendering, event handling, and basic collision detection. As a demonstration of its capabilities, a small mini-game has been created where a player avoids obstacles to survive.
